    "overview": "Jara, Alex and Miranda are three girls coming of age who grew up in a juvenile detention centre, with no knowledge of unconditional love. Jara\u2019s birthday is coming up and the three of them want to celebrate by going to the concert of their favourite performer, but they can\u2019t afford the tickets.  So, they meet up with an older girl and former resident of the centre who offers them an indecent proposal. But before they know it, they find themselves sliding deeper into the underbelly of Mallorca.",

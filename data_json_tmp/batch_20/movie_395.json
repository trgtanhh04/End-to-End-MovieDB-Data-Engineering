    "overview": "Luc\u00eda is arrested while driving her boyfriend H\u00e9ctor's car at 200 km/h, dazed and bloody. She was sharing a weekend at the beach with him and Elena, her best friend. Now they are both missing and Luc\u00eda only remembers a \u201clittle\u201d argument that ended with a bottle broken on H\u00e9ctor\u2019s head, but that\u2019s all. This complicates Simon\u2019s life. A private investigator? No. , thank you. Simon prefers to consider himself a simple \u201cjudicial expert\u201d. When his partner Oliver, a lawyer with financial problems due to gambling, asks him to investigate Luc\u00eda and the disappearances, Simon does not know that he is about to take the Expertise on another level. Obsessed with Bogart's film noir, Sim\u00f3n will go beyond all limits when he falls in love with Luc\u00eda, the amnesiac suspect in the murder he is investigating.",

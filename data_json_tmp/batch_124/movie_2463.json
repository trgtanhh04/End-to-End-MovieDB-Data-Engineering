Gwang-sik's son Myeong-ho and Hae-ra's daughter Dal-rae are brother and sister but they end up having sex. Their parents notice something is wrong but they pretend they don't know anything.

They end up colliding with their sexual desires for each other and in the end, their family is reconstructed.",

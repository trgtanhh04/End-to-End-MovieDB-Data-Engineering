    "overview": "Mr. Machi is a businessman fond of luxuries, easy money and women. A despicable person who abuses his power and position, but suddenly finds himself in an extreme situation: one morning, in broad daylight, he punctures a tire. But his surprise comes when he discovers the disfigured corpse of a stranger in his trunk.  Someone has set a trap for him. There he begins a desperate route to get rid of the body, discover his identity and know who is behind all this. One of the many enemies that he has cultivated over the years, from his own wife to co-workers, bodyguards and politicians. It could have been any of those that he has stepped on during these years to continue climbing or to consolidate his power, because for Luis Machi, people are so insignificant that from afar they look like flies.",

Equipped with a magical jade stone whose superpowers he doesn't yet know how to control, he is joined by his grandmother Na\u00efNa\u00ef and Indiana, a beautiful outlaw who can communicate with the world's fantastical creatures. But he is also flanked by Wowo, formerly a 3 meter-tall furry pachyderm, now turned into a tiny, cute and wacky furball by the magical jade stone.",

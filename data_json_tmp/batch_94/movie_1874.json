    "overview": "In the last years of the Middle Ages, the Corpus Christi procession takes place in the Spanish city of Toledo. There, the young Calixto meets the beautiful lady Melibea, and he falls in love immediately, trying to court her, but getting only the rejection of the young woman. Determined to make her his mistress, Calixto chases her wherever she goes, thus causing \"incidental\" encounters. Then the lover decides to follow the advice of his servant Sempronius and go to an old bawd called Celestina, who, with the help of her evil arts and tips, bow down Melibea's will and causes tragic consequences for everyone.",

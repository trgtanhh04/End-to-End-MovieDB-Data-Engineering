When the war begins at Donbass, Mykola\u2019s naive world is collapsing as the militants kill his pregnant wife and burn his home to the ground. Recovered, he makes a cardinal decision and gets enlisted in a sniper company. Having met his wife\u2019s killers, he emotionally breaks down and arranges \u201csniper terror\u201d for the enemy. He\u2019s saved from a senseless death by his instructor who himself gets mortally wounded. The death of a friend leaves a \u201cscar\u201d and Mykola is ready to sacrifice his life.",

    "overview": "Jeong-hee was living with a man due to a de facto marriage. One day, her daughter, Dam-hoi, returned from her study abroad. Dam-hoi always wears leggings. The soon-to-be stepdad, Byeong-min, who is usually a fan of leggings, pays attention to her daughter's clothes. Jeong-hee noticed it, so she also started wearing leggings to distract her young prospective husband.",

After attending countless weddings, they come up with a plan as bold as it is ingenious: to fund their dreams by organizing their own fake wedding! They announce their \"secret love,\" plan a big celebration, and at the crucial moment, Antonia is to leave Nicol\u00e1s standing at the altar. Confident that the scandal will discourage guests from claiming their gifts, they plan to split the loot. However, unexpected feelings begin to arise, which could complicate their brilliant plan.",

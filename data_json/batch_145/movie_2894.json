    "overview": "Wei Yangsheng went around looking for the whereabouts of his offspring's roots. When he came to the vicinity of Maoxi County, there was a loud voice outside the temple. It turned out that the nearby \"Yunyu Villa\" was pursuing a flower picker. Wei Yangsheng was misunderstood as a thief, so he fisted first. The owner, Nangong Yi, sees Weiyangsheng's talents at first glance, and he can't help but tolerate him not to kill, and instead he is imprisoned in secret. Wei Yangsheng was shocked for fear that the owner would have \"special hobbies\".",

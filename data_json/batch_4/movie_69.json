    "overview": "Gustavo idolizes his older brother Paco and his punk, \"Frikis\" bandmates. When word reaches the Frikis of a potential reprieve from the effects of the economic crisis, they do the now unthinkable: deliberately inject themselves with HIV to live at a government-run treatment home. It's there that they create their own utopia to live and play music freely.",

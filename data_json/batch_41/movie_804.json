    "overview": "An enigmatic international spy in the service of Russia and a Spanish agent of Moroccan origin working for Europol coincide in the Syrian city of Raqqa, an enclave of the self-proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS). Both, despite being on opposite sides, have a common goal, to locate the whereabouts of one of the main leaders of the Jihad, known as The Jordan, to facilitate his elimination and precipitate the fall of the organization. In an atmosphere of mutual distrust, both will have to evade dangers, from summary executions to women sold into slavery.",

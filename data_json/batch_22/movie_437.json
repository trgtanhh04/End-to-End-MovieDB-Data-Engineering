    "overview": "An international drugs deal goes wrong, and two New York hit-women are dispatched to Rome, Italy, to get the missing pay money. Even before departure the girls have a poolside hot party with two young men, and when they get to their hotel in Rome, they share a shower and an intimate moment together. At the beach, they make eye contact with a pair of Italian gigolos, then use judo and wrestling holds to dominate them - and impose their feminist supremacy. Finally, they will get close to the money, but their mission is made easier as the top men are fighting each other for it.",

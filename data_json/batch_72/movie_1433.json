    "overview": "Tomi Akiyama and her boyfriend Nakamura are troubled about allegations about a Comfort House in China. Tomi gets into the camp, first as a journalist, but is then captured and sent in as a participant. Nakamura is upset by this particular event, and the situation in general, and takes action. The progress of several other characters is followed, including a kind-of happy hooker, a jovial chubby Japanese woman and a brutal and rude general, laced with stock war footage and historical inter-titles.",
